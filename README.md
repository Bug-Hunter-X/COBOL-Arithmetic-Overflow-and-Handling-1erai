This repository demonstrates a common COBOL error: arithmetic overflow.  The `bug.cob` file contains code that can result in an overflow.  `bugSolution.cob` offers a more robust solution.  The primary concern is handling cases where numeric fields exceed their defined capacity. The improved solution adds explicit error checking and potentially alternative data types or strategies to handle situations exceeding the numeric field limits.
